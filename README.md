# 🔐 On-Chain Text Decoder — Caesar Cipher

Welcome to the **On-Chain Text Decoder** project — a simple, beginner-friendly blockchain application that demonstrates how smart contracts can be used for more than just tokens and finance.  
This project takes the classic **Caesar Cipher decoding technique** and runs it **on-chain**, making it fully transparent, verifiable, and unstoppable.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project allows users to decode Caesar-cipher encoded text using a deployed smart contract on the blockchain.  
Instead of relying on a backend server or local logic, the decoding happens **directly inside the blockchain**, ensuring:

- Trustless execution  
- On-chain transparency  
- No centralized dependency  

You interact with the smart contract through a simple UI where you input the encoded message and shift key — and the blockchain returns the decoded result.

Perfect for:

- Web3 Beginners  
- Students learning Solidity  
- Developers exploring smart contract → frontend integration  
- Blockchain experimentation projects

## 🛠 What It Does

✔ Takes an encoded string  
✔ Accepts a numeric shift value  
✔ Uses the Caesar decoding algorithm  
✔ Returns a readable decoded message — **computed on-chain**

No wallet signing for the read function. No gas to decode. Just blockchain logic in action.
